# Basic IRC Client

## Preamble
This is my first "big" Go project, so if there's a better way to implement my ideas (since I'm coming from Nodejs) that would be super appreciated so that I can learn Go idioms and a new way of thinking.

## Goals
* Parse incoming messages and turn them into structs [✅]
* Send structs out of the IRC client object [✅]
* Keep track of errors outside of IRC client [✅]
* Support all types of user input [ ]
    * Login [✅]
    * Join [✅]
    * Part [✅]
    * Privmsg [ ]
    * Mode change [ ]
* Others, probably
